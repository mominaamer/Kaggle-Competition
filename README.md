## 1) Santa's Workshop Tour 2019
Hammers ring, are you listenin’ In the shop, toys are glistenin’ Should they see the sights? There might be a fight… Walkin’ ‘round the Workshop Wonderland

Families said, they want to see it Santa said, he’d guarantee it They pick a date But they may have to wait Walkin’ ‘round the Workshop Wonderland
We told Santa that he was a madman He just wants to make sure they all smile He’ll say “Are you flexible?“, They’ll say “Yeah man, But can you help us make it worth our while?”

“Give them food, or sweater the more they wait, the gifts get better” Please help us rank Or we’ll break the bank! Walkin’ ’round the Workshop Wonderland

Santa has exciting news! For 100 days before Christmas, he opened up tours to his workshop. Because demand was so strong, and because Santa wanted to make things as fair as possible, he let each of the 5,000 families that will visit the workshop choose a list of dates they'd like to attend the workshop.

Now that all the families have sent Santa their preferences, he's realized it's impossible for everyone to get their top picks, so he's decided to provide extra perks for families that don't get their preferences. In addition, Santa's accounting department has told him that, depending on how families are scheduled, there may be some unexpected and hefty costs incurred.

Santa needs the help of the Kaggle community to optimize which day each family is assigned to attend the workshop in order to minimize any extra expenses that would cut into next years toy budget! Can you help Santa out?

## 2) University of Liverpool - Ion Switching

Think you can use your data science skills to make big predictions at a submicroscopic level?

Many diseases, including cancer, are believed to have a contributing factor in common. Ion channels are pore-forming proteins present in animals and plants. They encode learning and memory, help fight infections, enable pain signals, and stimulate muscle contraction. If scientists could better study ion channels, which may be possible with the aid of machine learning, it could have a far-reaching impact.



When ion channels open, they pass electric currents. Existing methods of detecting these state changes are slow and laborious. Humans must supervise the analysis, which imparts considerable bias, in addition to being tedious. These difficulties limit the volume of ion channel current analysis that can be used in research. Scientists hope that technology could enable rapid automatic detection of ion channel current events in raw data.

The University of Liverpool’s Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease is working to advance ion channel research. Their team of scientists have asked for your help. In this competition, you’ll use ion channel data to better model automatic identification methods. If successful, you’ll be able to detect individual ion channel events in noisy raw signals. The data is simulated and injected with real world noise to emulate what scientists observe in laboratory experiments.

Technology to analyze electrical data in cells has not changed significantly over the past 20 years. If we better understand ion channel activity, the research could impact many areas related to cell health and migration. From human diseases to how climate change affects plants, faster detection of ion channels could greatly accelerate solutions to major world problems.
