## 1) Santa's Workshop Tour 2019
Hammers ring, are you listenin’ In the shop, toys are glistenin’ Should they see the sights? There might be a fight… Walkin’ ‘round the Workshop Wonderland

Families said, they want to see it Santa said, he’d guarantee it They pick a date But they may have to wait Walkin’ ‘round the Workshop Wonderland
We told Santa that he was a madman He just wants to make sure they all smile He’ll say “Are you flexible?“, They’ll say “Yeah man, But can you help us make it worth our while?”

“Give them food, or sweater the more they wait, the gifts get better” Please help us rank Or we’ll break the bank! Walkin’ ’round the Workshop Wonderland

Santa has exciting news! For 100 days before Christmas, he opened up tours to his workshop. Because demand was so strong, and because Santa wanted to make things as fair as possible, he let each of the 5,000 families that will visit the workshop choose a list of dates they'd like to attend the workshop.

Now that all the families have sent Santa their preferences, he's realized it's impossible for everyone to get their top picks, so he's decided to provide extra perks for families that don't get their preferences. In addition, Santa's accounting department has told him that, depending on how families are scheduled, there may be some unexpected and hefty costs incurred.

Santa needs the help of the Kaggle community to optimize which day each family is assigned to attend the workshop in order to minimize any extra expenses that would cut into next years toy budget! Can you help Santa out?

## 2) University of Liverpool - Ion Switching

Think you can use your data science skills to make big predictions at a submicroscopic level?

Many diseases, including cancer, are believed to have a contributing factor in common. Ion channels are pore-forming proteins present in animals and plants. They encode learning and memory, help fight infections, enable pain signals, and stimulate muscle contraction. If scientists could better study ion channels, which may be possible with the aid of machine learning, it could have a far-reaching impact.



When ion channels open, they pass electric currents. Existing methods of detecting these state changes are slow and laborious. Humans must supervise the analysis, which imparts considerable bias, in addition to being tedious. These difficulties limit the volume of ion channel current analysis that can be used in research. Scientists hope that technology could enable rapid automatic detection of ion channel current events in raw data.

The University of Liverpool’s Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease is working to advance ion channel research. Their team of scientists have asked for your help. In this competition, you’ll use ion channel data to better model automatic identification methods. If successful, you’ll be able to detect individual ion channel events in noisy raw signals. The data is simulated and injected with real world noise to emulate what scientists observe in laboratory experiments.

Technology to analyze electrical data in cells has not changed significantly over the past 20 years. If we better understand ion channel activity, the research could impact many areas related to cell health and migration. From human diseases to how climate change affects plants, faster detection of ion channels could greatly accelerate solutions to major world problems.

# 3) 2020 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey

Welcome to Kaggle's annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey competition! You can read our executive summary here.

This year, as in 2017, 2018, and 2019 we set out to conduct an industry-wide survey that presents a truly comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The survey was live for 3.5 weeks in October, and after cleaning the data we finished with 20,036 responses!

There's a lot to explore here. The results include raw numbers about who is working with data, what’s happening with machine learning in different industries, and the best ways for new data scientists to break into the field. We've published the data in as raw a format as possible without compromising anonymization, which makes it an unusual example of a survey dataset.

This year Kaggle is once again launching an annual Data Science Survey Challenge, where we will be awarding a prize pool of $30,000 to notebook authors who tell a rich story about a subset of the data science and machine learning community.

In our fourth year running this survey, we were once again awed by the global, diverse, and dynamic nature of the data science and machine learning industry. This survey data EDA provides an overview of the industry on an aggregate scale, but it also leaves us wanting to know more about the many specific communities comprised within the survey. For that reason, we’re inviting the Kaggle community to dive deep into the survey datasets and help us tell the diverse stories of data scientists from around the world.

The challenge objective: tell a data story about a subset of the data science community represented in this survey, through a combination of both narrative text and data exploration. A “story” could be defined any number of ways, and that’s deliberate. The challenge is to deeply explore (through data) the impact, priorities, or concerns of a specific group of data science and machine learning practitioners. That group can be defined in the macro (for example: anyone who does most of their coding in Python) or the micro (for example: female data science students studying machine learning in masters programs). This is an opportunity to be creative and tell the story of a community you identify with or are passionate about!
